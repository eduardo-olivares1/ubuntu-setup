# Ubuntu Setup (22.04) - Prefrences

## About
I always distro hop and then come crawling back to Ubuntu once I get tired
of punishing myself with arch or something like that. And rather than have 
to reinstall everything from scratch, this will be a utility to use to 
quickly reinstall my favorites.

## Requirements
- Ubuntu 22.04 
- apt
- dpkg
- snap

## Roadmap
- [X] Setup system-wide prefrences
- [X] Setup user prefrences
- [X] Finalize parent .sh script
- [ ] Create CLI w/ Python
